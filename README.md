Hello!

My mother wanted to name me after a Fleetwood Mac song called "Rhiannon" 
but she misheard it as Bryana. 

I grew up in Tennessee, but it wasn't the right place for me. 
Now, I reside in Colorado.
With her proud mountains tall.

Things are pretty good and I'm trying to learn some new things. 
I work with software so I'm trying to learn more about it.
